    "For this Lab you guys will be going through the thought-process of how Data Scientists in the real world extract, clean, explore and eventually visualize data to make inferences about real-world problems. Since this is a guided-lab it will be graded just as strictly since everything is provided to you.\n",

    "**Note:** Please make sure you use the environment you guys created for Homework 2 - the one which contains Seaborn 0.9.0 - as it would be extremely difficult for you to make the same plots as in the blog post otherwise. Open the Homework 2 notebook if you are unsure on how to switch to that environment.\n",
