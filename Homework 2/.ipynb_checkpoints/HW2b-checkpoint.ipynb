    "From here onwards, how exactly you structure your code is upto you, and the main goal is this: You want to choose a regression model from one of the many [linear_models](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.linear_model) available on sklearn. If you're feeling adventurous you can try using [Support Vector Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html) as well, but unless you guys take out the time to understand how Support Vector Machines work, and why they might not be the best idea for such a dataset, it will not be a fruitful exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to learn how to evaluate your model. Every sklearn regression model has a built in function that can calculate the regression score for you (as done before), and the sklearn [Mean Squared Error](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html) function will be used to calculate the error in your test-set and your train-set. In most cases you will use either a custom function to split the dataset into a train-test set, or use the [train-test-split](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function. Another extremely useful tool is [KFold cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). Research on cross-validation and why it is such an effective way to evaluate your Machine Learning models.\n",

    "1. Regression Score \n",
    "2. Mean Squared Error (Expect this to be really high, since the values of the data-set are also high)\n",
    "3. The Regression Line that you get from the linear-models (either from the coefficients or from the predictions) over the data-points (I will upload a sample on Piazza)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lastly**, after you have trained your model, you need to build a mock data-set containing just the datetime objects. A good function to use is [python.date_range](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.date_range.html) that allows you to get a DateTimeIndex of whatever Date and Frequency you chose (the frequency is an extremely important parameter). You can convert that DateTimeIndex to a DataFrame and then extract the same features as you did in the previous part (making a function for feature extraction is a good idea). After that you need to print the exact **Month and Year that the 1.5 Trillion Rs target will be reached according to your regression.**\n",
